# MENACE
Self trained menace

Menace - Matchbox Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine
One of the first Reinforcement Learning algorithms made. This was used to play tic-tac-toe intelligently.

## Behaviour
MENACE doesn't know the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe. It doesn't know that three-in-a-row wins. It only picks out of a learned whitelist moves from each game board possibility.
We need to teach it this whitelist (The ideal moves on every game board possible)
